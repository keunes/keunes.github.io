# Podcasting 2.0

The Podcasting 2.0 was initiated by Adam Curry and Dave Jones to innovate the Podcasting industry. The end-goal: protect this medium of free speech from increasing silos like the iTunes database and Spotify's walled podcasting garden.

Like anything good, it comes in three:
* the Podcast Index
* the Podcast Namespace
* a podcast about the initiative's latest developments
