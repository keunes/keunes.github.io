# Podcasting 2.0

The Podcasting 2.0 was initiated by Adam Curry and Dave Jones to innovate the Podcasting industry. The end-goal: protect this medium of free speech from increasing silos like the iTunes database and Spotify's walled podcasting garden.

Like anything good, it comes in three:
* the Podcast Index
* the Podcast Namespace
* a podcast about the initiative's latest developments

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
