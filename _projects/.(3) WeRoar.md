# We Roar

Working already on communication/promotion for [AntennaPod](./AntennaPod) and indicating willingness to help [Funkwhale](https://www.funkwhale.audio) with that too, I was asked by the new Funkwhale maintainer if I'd be interested in hosting a podcast with regular development updates. Having dreamt of making a podcast but having not really an idea what it could be about, I loved the idea. Finally a topic I'd comfortably host!

It also lined up well with another idea I had before: connecting different open source audio projects, mainly in order to facilitate interoperability. For example for the developments of shared API calls regarding favourite tracks, episode statuses, and search queries. I envision the podcast being the 'communication channel' of the community, a convenient way of staying up to date with the developments of the project.

## The podcast

What the podcast will be like exactly: don't know yet. I guess it'll be released every two weeks or maybe monthly. In any case I hope to provide short development updates on the different projects, and an occasional longer chat about a topic (technical or project-management) related to or suggested by one of the projects. But plenty of stuff to do before release:

* [ ] Getting a microphone
* [ ] Choosing a starting music
* [ ] Installing ~~this new audacity fork~~ [Tenacity](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity)
* [ ] Finding out what kind of things to talk about
* [ ] Find a co-host/occasional side-kick?
* [ ] Write up some text for a trial/demo episode
* [ ] Record and montage a very first thing

## The network

There's plenty of open source project in the (very wide) audio domain. It won't be feasible (or useful), however, to engage all. So for now I hope to get people from the two abovementioned projects interested. And there's a third we have in mind. But, let's see. First focus is on the podcast.

In any case the domain is registered: weroar.dev (`dev` as it's a network of developers, and because it was one of the few still available :P).
